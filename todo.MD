### Urgent
 - Release mechanic with sensors and actual chain effect. Then Combat can be consideres as "refined".

### Later
- Add `Attacking` in an observer or in a system through an event so both enemy and Player use the same.
- Refine attack movement and attack hitboxes. Look at bevy_tween and bevy_lookup_curve.
- Refactor main.rs.

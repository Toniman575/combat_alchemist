### Urgent

- Basic sound

### Later

- Animations and attacking systems are a complete mess.
- Completetly overhaul the `trigger_mark` implementation.
- Add `Attacking` in an observer or in a system through an event so both enemy and Player use the same.
- Refine attack movement and attack hitboxes. Look at bevy_lookup_curve and maybe bevy tween?
- Refactor main.rs.
- Figure out if zlayer transform affects collisions?
